# Contributing to Skiperator

## Getting started with development

### Installing dependencies

You're going to want to make sure to have the following things installed:

- [Operator SDK](https://sdk.operatorframework.io/docs/building-operators/golang/installation)
- golang
- kubectl
- [kubectx and kubens](https://github.com/ahmetb/kubectx)
- docker version 17.03+.
- [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io)
- [istioctl](https://istio.io/latest/docs/setup/install/istioctl/)
- wget
- [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/docs/installation/)

### Running the operator

Check out the project from git. If you want to get to know the project
hierarchy, have a look at the [kubebuilder documentation](https://book.kubebuilder.io/cronjob-tutorial/basic-project.html).

```
$ git clone git@github.com:kartverket/skiperator.git
$ cd skiperator/
```

Start a cluster on docker using `kind`.

```
$ kind create cluster
```

Make sure Kind is the active context

```
$ kubectx kind-kind
```

Optionally you may create a new namespace for Skiperator, for example

```
$ kubectl create namespace skiperator-system
$ kubens skiperator-system
```

Install Istio to make sure all CRDs are available

```
$ istioctl install
```

Cert-manager (version in link above) must be installed locally on your cluster with

```
$ kubectl apply -f https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager/releases/download/<VERSION>/cert-manager.yaml
```

Roles and CRDs are autogenerated and can be generated with

```
$ make generate
```

and installed in the cluster with

```
$ kubectl apply -f deployment
```

A minimal application resource is provided in the samples folder and can be applied with

```
$ kubectl apply -f samples/application.yaml
```

To start `skiperator` locally on your computer, you can use the the make target `run-local`
which will generate CRD's, apply them in your local kind-cluster, build and run skiperator.
The default `kubectl` context is `kind-kind`. To override, set the env-variable `SKIPERATOR_CONTEXT`
to the name of the desired context.

```
$ make run-local
```

Now you should have a running app in your namespace. Run the following command
to see all the created resources.

```
$ kubectl get Application,all,networkpolicies,PeerAuthentication,Gateway,VirtualService,Sidecar
```

Changes to the api requires the CRD to be generated and applied again, and changes to the application controllers requires skiperator to be rebuilt and startet again.

Use the command `make run-local` to do this in a safe way without mixing up kubectl contexts.

## Adding/debugging metrics
The operator exposes prometheus metrics by default on `:8080/metrics`.

You can view the metrics by simply visiting `http://localhost:8080/metrics` in your browser.

Or you can download `prometheus` to your computer, either as a binary or docker-image,
and use the sample configuration `samples/prometheus.yml` to scrape skiperator.

```
prometheus --config.file=samples/prometheus.yml
```

Then visit `http://localhost:9090` to use the prometheus expression tool to view different metrics in table- or graph-view.

## Writing code

Have a look at the following files:

- The main logic is found in the controllers, which are split for their respective resources https://github.com/kartverket/skiperator/blob/main/controllers
- The `Application` Custom Resource API is found in https://github.com/kartverket/skiperator/blob/main/api/v1alpha1/application.go
- A very simple example `Application` that can be applied to the cluster is found in https://github.com/kartverket/skiperator/tree/main/samples/

Also look at the following documentation pages:

- https://sdk.operatorframework.io/docs/building-operators/golang/tutorial
- https://sdk.operatorframework.io/docs/building-operators/golang/references/client/
