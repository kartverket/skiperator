# Contributing to Skiperator

## Getting started with development

### Installing dependencies

You're going to want to make sure to have the following things installed:

- [Operator SDK](https://sdk.operatorframework.io/docs/building-operators/golang/installation)
- golang
- kubectl
- [kubectx and kubens](https://github.com/ahmetb/kubectx)
- docker version 17.03+.
- [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io)
- [istioctl](https://istio.io/latest/docs/setup/install/istioctl/)
- wget
- [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/docs/installation/)

### Running the operator

Check out the project from git. If you want to get to know the project
hierarchy, have a look at the [kubebuilder documentation](https://book.kubebuilder.io/cronjob-tutorial/basic-project.html).

```
$ git clone git@github.com:kartverket/skiperator.git
$ cd skiperator/
```

Start a cluster on docker using `kind`.

```
$ kind create cluster
```

Make sure Kind is the active context

```
$Â kubectx kind-kind
```

Optionally you may create a new namespace for Skiperator, for example

```
$ kubectl create namespace skiperator-system
$ kubens skiperator-system
```

Install Istio to make sure all CRDs are available

```
$ istioctl install
```

Cert-manager (version in link above) must be installed locally on your cluster with

```
$ kubectl apply -f https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager/releases/download/<VERSION>/cert-manager.yaml
```

Roles and CRDs are autogenerated and can be generated with

```
$ make generate
```

and installed in the cluster with

```
$ kubectl apply -f deployment
```

A minimal application resource is provided in the debug folder and can be applied with

```
$ kubectl apply -f samples/application.yaml
```

To start the application locally on your computer, you must first build the application using

```
$ make build
```

You may then start the application with

```
$ ./bin/skiperator
```

Now you should have a running app in your namespace. Run the following command
to see all the created resources.

```
$ kubectl get Application,all,networkpolicies,PeerAuthentication,Gateway,VirtualService,Sidecar
```

Should you make changes to the application controllers, you will have to rebuild and restart the Skiperator application. First, exit the application process, then run

```
$ make build
$ ./bin/skiperator
```

Your changes should then be applied.

## Writing code

Have a look at the following files:

- The main logic is found in the controllers, which are split for their respective resources https://github.com/kartverket/skiperator/blob/main/controllers
- The `Application` Custom Resource API is found in https://github.com/kartverket/skiperator/blob/main/api/v1alpha1/application.go
- A very simple example `Application` that can be applied to the cluster is found in https://github.com/kartverket/skiperator/tree/main/samples/

Also look at the following documentation pages:

- https://sdk.operatorframework.io/docs/building-operators/golang/tutorial
- https://sdk.operatorframework.io/docs/building-operators/golang/references/client/
