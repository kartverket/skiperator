          Application

          Root object for Application resource. An application resource is a resource for easily managing a Dockerized container within the context of a Kartverket cluster.
          This allows product teams to avoid the need to set up networking on the cluster, as well as a lot of out of the box security features.

                description: |-
                  Kubernetes uses startup probes to know when a container application has started.
                  If such a probe is configured, it disables liveness and readiness checks until it
                  succeeds, making sure those probes don't interfere with the application startup.
                  This can be used to adopt liveness checks on slow starting containers, avoiding them
                  getting killed by Kubernetes before they are up and running.
                  Startup is optional, but when provided, path and port are required
